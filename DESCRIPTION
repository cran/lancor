Description: Implementation of the methods described in Holzmann, Klar (2024) 
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2303.17872>. Lancaster correlation is a correlation coefficient 
    which equals the absolute value of the Pearson correlation for the bivariate 
    normal distribution, and is equal to or slightly less than the maximum 
    correlation coefficient for a variety of bivariate distributions. Rank and 
    moment-based estimators and corresponding confidence intervals are 
    implemented, as well as independence tests based on these statistics.
